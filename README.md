# AnkaraMedipol_Mobile_App
<p> We decided to make Ankara Medipol University Mobile Application. 
   First of all, we planned to design an application with interactive content that students can participate in more.
  It was important for us to get ideas from our main user audience, the students, to determine what would be in the content of the app.
  That's why we started our project by exchanging ideas with students, especially our close friends.
  We continued our project by shaping our application for student needs. If we need to briefly mention the content of our project. </p>

## Features
<ul>
  <li>As the landing page, the user login section, where students can enter with their school e-mail, welcomes us.</li>
  <li> Home page is designed as Navigation Menu. In this menu; Medipol Time, Medipol Map, Images from the University, TTO, MEBIS, Social Media and Places to Visit. Thanks to the screens in the menu, the users can access the news about the school, the current academic calendar, the school's social media accounts, the school's map, and the TTO and MEBIS screens directly through the application. Through the Campus Life screen on the bottom bar of the application, users can access cafes, classrooms, libraries, stationery, dormitories for girls and boys, school clubs, rings, etc. information about the places. Again, on the Medipol Dental Hospital screen, which can be accessed via the bottom bar of the application, users can easily access the procedures performed at the dental hospital, the location of the hospital and the call center.</li>
</ul>
